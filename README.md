# GKR_semantic_parser

This is the Graphical Knowledge Representation (GKR) parser. It transforms a given sentence into a layered semantic graph as described
in Kalouli, A.-L. and Richard Crouch. 2018. GKR: the Graphical Knowledge Representation for semantic parsing. In Proceedings of SEMBEaR 2018
@ NAACL 2018 : http://aclweb.org/anthology/W18-1304 

Author/developer: Aikaterini-Lida Kalouli <aikaterini-lida.kalouli@uni-konstanz.de> and Richard Crouch <dick.crouch@gmail.com>

If you use this software in writing scientific papers, or you use this
software in any other medium serving scientists or students (e.g. web-sites,
CD-ROMs) please include the above citation.


How to install and run the GKR parser: 

1. Clone the repository into your desired directory: git clone https://github.com/kkalouli/GKR_semantic_parser.git

2.  Download WordNet from http://wordnet.princeton.edu/wordnet/download/.
In order to use WordNet, you must configure the file GKR_semantic_parser/sem.mapper/gkr.properties. 
In particular you must change the following line:

wn_location=/usr/local/Cellar/wordnet/3.1/dict

Change the location and set the directory in which the WordNet dictionary is installed.

3. Download and install JIGSAW as described in https://github.com/pippokill/JIGSAW. 
Although you will have downloaded WordNet by now, make sure you follow the JIGSAW instructions for modifying the JIGSAW config file in
JIGSAW/resources/wn_file_properties.xml . In the same JIGSAW config file replace the relative paths of nlp.tokenModel, nlp.posTagModel and 
nlp.stopWordFile with the absolute paths of their location in your system.

In order to use JIGSAW, you must also configure the file GKR_semantic_parser/sem.mapper/gkr.properties. 
In particular you must change the following line:

jigsaw_props=jigsaw.properties

Change the properties file name and set the absolute path in which your jigsaw.properties file is installed. 

4. Download and install SUMO as described in https://github.com/ontologyportal/sigmakee. 
In order to use SUMO, you must also configure the file GKR_semantic_parser/sem.mapper/gkr.properties. 
In particular you must change the following line:

sumo_location=/Users/kkalouli/Documents/workspace/sumo

Change the location and set the location path in which you installed the parent SUMO folder. 

5. Download the jar file edu.mit.jwi_2.4.0.jar from https://projects.csail.mit.edu/jwi/.

6. Create a new folder GKR_libs somewhere in your system. Copy in this folder the following files:
- the edu.mit.jwi_2.4.0.jar jar file
- the JIGSAW.jar file (found in the folder dist of your JIGSAW installation)
- the maxent-3.0.0.jar file (found in the folder dist/lib/ of your JIGSAW installation)
- opennlp-tools-1.5.0.jar (found in the folder dist/lib/ of your JIGSAW installation)

You are all set! You can now build the project:
Navigate to the cloned directory (GKR_semantic_parser) and do: gradle build

If the build is successful, you can simply import the project in Eclipse or any other platform you wish.
For Eclipse: import it as a gradle project
(for changes made within eclipse, the 'gradle cleanEclipse' command should refresh the eclipse view)



How to test a sentence:

In the subproject sem.mapper there is a class named DepGraphToSemanticGraph.
In the main method at the end of this class you can run only one sentence or a testsuite with sentences: just comment in or
out the corresponding method.
